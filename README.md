# formula-one-image-classification-model
Repository holds code and data for image classification model - of cars representing particular teams in Formula 1.

# Rpository structure
- `/input`: data for model training, validation and testing are stored here. The amount of images commited is an example - I reduced their number to lessen the amount of storage held in GitHub/GitLab,
- `/logs`: place for logs created during model training,
- `/models`: space for binary model file (h5 format),
- `formula-one-image-classification.ipynb`: improved / fixed jupyter notebook explaining model training process (once again, by [faw](https://github.com/faw01)).
